# CMAT Documentation (Project MOZARKITE)
### Mozarkite
> Mozarkite is a form of chert (flint). It is the state rock of Missouri. The name is a portmanteau, formed from Mo (Missouri), zark (Ozarks), and ite (meaning rock).

## Note from the creators:
Since the main components of the CMAT kit are MOCYBER's ROCK platform, we found it fitting to name it after MO's State Rock.

As a git repo, this serves as the primary source of documentation for the Cyber Mission Assurance Team (CMAT) kit. This repository does not cover the concept of operations (CONOPS) for the team but rather how to build the equipment and the ideas of employing (CONEMP) the kit.

This documentation was made with the best effort on a short timeline. Most of the documentation is correct, but there could be nuances or minor details that still need to be adjusted to your environment. Please contribute fixes back to the project.
